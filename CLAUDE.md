# CLAUDE.MD
## A document for you, to help guide you when building software in this project. This document will be updated in accordance to new rules.

# Rules
- You must not create unnececary markdown files. When you are done with an implomentation, just explain in the chat window. Never create files such as "IMPLOMENTATION.md" "QUICKSTART.md". Its a waste of our time.
- The Rust build is: ~/.cargo/bin/cargo build 2>&1




Thats all for now.
